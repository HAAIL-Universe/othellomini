Othello/FELLO is a multi-agent, ethics-first AI system built in Python that functions as a deeply personalized life intelligence platform. The architecture follows a five-layer brain-inspired model. At the top, an OutputGate applies final ethical, safety, and consent filters before any output reaches the user.
