# Manifesto: OthelloMini

## I. Consent Before Capability
Every feature, every agent action, every proactive suggestion must pass through an ethical gatekeeper before reaching the user. The system does not optimize for engagement or persuasion — it optimizes for user autonomy.

- All AI-generated actions surface as consent-gated prompts; no stealth automation
- Tier-based consent model (Passive → Suggestive → Active → Autonomous) enforced at the architectural level
- Default to transparency: when in doubt, show reasoning, ask permission, log the decision

## II. Psychological Integrity Over Feature Velocity
Personalization is not about data hoarding — it's about building a persistent, accurate model of the user's values, goals, and patterns. This requires thoughtful agent design, not rapid feature iteration.

- Sub-agents (traits, behavior, aspirations, mood) work as specialized observers, not intrusive trackers
- Memory and modeling must be accurate, not just abundant; quality signals over data volume
- No dark patterns: do not exploit psychological insights for retention or engagement metrics

## III. Simplicity as Ethical Interface Design
Complex ethical systems must not overwhelm the user. A warm, conversational chat interface is the primary mode of interaction — transparency is available on demand, not imposed.

- Chat-first UI: feels like a trusted advisor, not a control panel
- Inline consent prompts: approve/deny without breaking conversation flow
- Transparency on demand: agent reasoning, ethical logs, digital shadow visible when user chooses, hidden when not needed

## IV. Architecture Reflects Values
The five-layer brain-inspired model (OutputGate, orchestration, agents, memory, tools) is not just technical design — it's an ethical commitment. The OutputGate enforces boundaries; FELLO and sub-agents enable understanding; RealityAgent plans interventions only when consent permits.

- Ethics layer (Othello/OutputGate) is non-negotiable and cannot be bypassed by lower layers
- Agent autonomy balanced by architectural constraints: agents suggest, users decide
- Memory persistence enables genuine understanding but must respect user-defined limits and deletion rights
