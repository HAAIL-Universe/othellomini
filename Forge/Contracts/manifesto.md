# Manifesto: OthelloMini

## Core Principles

### 1. Ethics Before Output
- Every suggestion, action, and intervention must pass through the OutputGate ethical filter — no exceptions.
- Consent boundaries are non-negotiable: the system operates only within user-defined autonomy tiers (Passive → Suggestive → Active → Autonomous).
- Transparency on demand: users can always inspect ethical validation logs and agent reasoning traces.

### 2. Genuine Understanding Over Feature Velocity
- Persistent psychological modeling is the foundation — sub-agents continuously track traits, behavior, mood, and aspirations to build a true digital shadow.
- Personalization depth trumps feature breadth: better to deliver one deeply understood suggestion than ten generic prompts.
- The system remembers and evolves with the user over time, not per session.

### 3. Calm Intelligence, Not Control Theater
- Chat-first interface must feel like a trusted advisor, not a dashboard full of dials.
- Ethical prompts and consent controls surface inline, gently — no aggressive interruptions or anxiety-inducing permission gates.
- Complexity lives beneath simplicity: sophisticated multi-agent reasoning hidden behind warm, conversational interaction.

### 4. Proactive Reality Shaping, User-Gated Action
- The RealityAgent plans real-world interventions (routine nudges, scheduling, goal coaching) but never executes without consent.
- Suggestions must be actionable, specific, and contextually aware — not vague encouragement.
- Autonomy escalation is gradual and always user-controlled: the system earns trust through consistency, not by demanding permissions upfront.
